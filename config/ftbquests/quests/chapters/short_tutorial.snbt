				"&bThin Air"
				"Thin Air introduces air mechanics, making it harder and harder to breath the further you move away from the world's sea level. Both adventuring in caves as well as climbing tall moutains have suddently become quite dangerous if you don't bring a sufficient air supply! This only affects the Overworld for now. Check the Thin Air \\& Cold Sweat Questsline."

				"&9Cold &cSweat"
				"Cold Sweat adds a temprature mechanic to the game. Do not worry, it has been configured to be easy to deal with. It is in Celsuis so make sure to check your temprature bottom left and not make it go below 5 degrees or above 40 degrees. Check the Thin Air \\& Cold Sweat Questsline.  "
				" "
				"&aVillager Comfort"
				"Villager comfort makes villagers price their trades based on how comfy is their lifestyle. This is in an effort to discourage building narrow trading halls with no daylight access and no place for villagers to walk around and meet each other, and instead reward the player for building a bigger and safer village, which makes villagers comfier, thus lowering trade prices."
